## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a four-credit course with laboratory. You should expect to spend, on average, 1 hours per week on this class.***
 This blended class has the same time expectations as the face-to-face version of this course –-- 5 hours per week in the classroom –-- 3 hours of lecture/discussion time and 2 hours of laboratory time. In addition, there is an expectation to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week during the semester outside of the classroom, reading the textbook, studying, doing assignments, working on projects, and practicing in order to master the concepts and techniques covered in the course. (See Definition of the Credit Hour)
Since this class is a blended class, we will spend 4 of the 5 classroom hours in a face-to-face classroom and the remaining 1 hour online, bringing the out-of-class total to 7 hours per week. 

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

## Course PhilosophyEven though this course will be using the Java programming language and its associated libraries, much of what you will be learning is language independent. Therefore, we will place an emphasis on concepts and techniques, in addition to the particulars of the Java programming language.You are encouraged to help each other out, in and out of the classroom, as long as you do your own work. (See Academic Conduct below.)<!--## Instructional MethodsThis class will not be a traditional “lecture” class, and will incorporate some teaching methods that may be unfamiliar to you.### Flipped ClassroomYou will be given reading assignments in the iJava textbook and from other sources, and you will be expected to complete a short quiz on the reading assignment(s) before the class meeting. Your answers from the quiz will be used to tailor what we do in the classroom. If everyone understands a topic or concept, we will not spend time on it in class. If a large portion of the class is having difficulties with a topic or concept, we will work on it in class to make sure everyone understands.Your quizzes will be graded on the effort you put into explaining your answer. If you do not complete the quiz by the specified time, you will not receive any points for that quiz.This flipped classroom technique means that I will spend much less time “telling” you things that you already understand from the reading, and more time on the concepts that you find difficult.### Peer InstructionIn the classroom, you will often be presented with a problem and a set of possible answers. You will “vote” for the correct answer using your browser. Then you will discuss your answer and your explanation with your classmates. Once you have completed your discussions, you will vote again. If the discussions have helped the class understand the material better, we will move on to other topics. If there is still difficulty with the material, we will spend more time with additional explanations and problems.This time spent actively discussing the material with your classmates will help you develop a deeper understanding of the concepts.### Pair ProgrammingDuring labs, you will work in a pair with one of your classmates. One of you will type while the other makes suggestions, watches for errors, reads the assignment, and thinks ahead. You will switch roles frequently during the lab session. You will be randomly assigned a new partner each lab. This will allow you to get to know the other members of the class, work with partners of different abilities and programming styles, and develop relationships that may extend beyond to classroom.-->

## Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) Sessions
Your success in this course is important, and is being supported in the Spring 2017 semester by Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) sessions run by the [Aisiku STEM Center](http://www.worcester.edu/Aisiku-STEM-Center/) at WSU. PAL is being provided in selected courses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, and Mathematics.

Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) sessions are student-led, instructor-supported, group study and review sessions run by trained student facilitators who were highly successful themselves in the course themselves. These student leaders have been trained to develop group learning activities using a variety of strategies. The PAL leaders will be attending the regular classroom sessions and meeting with the course instructors regularly to prepare their PAL sessions.

There will be two CS 140 PAL sessions offered per week by the PAL leader. You can attend any one of the sessions that fits your schedule (you may even attend more than one if you wish!) The sessions will consist of group activities where you will interact with your classmates to form a deeper understanding of the course material.

Attendance at these sessions is voluntary, but highly encouraged. National research has shown that students who attend PAL sessions have a significantly lower rate of D grades, failures and course withdrawals. And PAL sessions are not just for struggling students - the same research has shown that all students who attend PAL sessions get higher grades than those who do not.

The PAL student leader will introduce himself during the first class session, and times for the sessions will be announced soon after classes start.

Your attendance at the PAL sessions is not reported to the course instructor, to ensure that all students in the course are treated equally and fairly with regard to grading.

*PAL provided by WSU's Imoigele P. Aisiku, M.D., ’92 STEM Center is supported by the Workforce Preparation Support Program generously funded by philanthropic support from The Fairlawn Foundation Fund at Greater Worcester Community Foundation.*

## Grading PoliciesThere will be homework assignments and quizzes, laboratory assignments, programming projects, and three exams. Your grade in the course will be determined as follows:
 
Assignment Category | Percentage
---|:-:
Attendance and Class participation | 4%Laboratory Assignments | 12%Quizzes on Readings | 12%CodeLab Practice | 12%Programming Projects | 20%Exams (3) | 40%

### Grading Scale
Percentage | Letter Grade 
:-:|:-:
93--100% | A
90--93% | A-
87--90% | B+
83--87% | B
80--83% | B-
77--80% | C+
73--77% | C
70--73% | C-
67--70% | D+
63--67% | D
60--63% | D-
less than 60% | E 

Each range includes the lower value, but not the upper value. For example, the range of 80 to 83 includes all grades up to, but not including 83. The highest range does, however, include 100%.
## Quizzes on ReadingsYou will take quizzes on the readings before class that will guide the development of the in-class sessions.

## CodeLab PracticeThe CodeLab site provides Java code-writing practice, with feedback, to help you master writing code.
## Laboratory AssignmentsThe laboratory assignments provide you with the chance to explore the Java language and development tools in an incremental, guided way. This will help you develop confidence and mastery before you are asked to complete programming projects on your own.
## Programming ProjectsThe programming projects will give you a chance to apply the material to larger tasks. These projects will require you to understand a design, implement that design in code, test, and debug it. Your code will have to follow formatting and documentation standards.

## ExamsExam 1 will be given on 15 February 2017<br>Exam 2 will be given on 15 March 2017<br>Exam 3 will be given on 3 May 2017<br>

## Deliverables
All work must be submitted electronically. The submission method, due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the timestamp in Blackboard, GitLab, or CodeLab.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

It is strongly recommended that you keep copies of your projects. Students are responsible for reproducing any lost work including unreadable files.

Graded assignments (with comments and solutions) will be returned to you electronically. *Please make sure that you review the comments and solutions provided so you can improve your future work.*

## Late Submissions
**Late assignments are not accepted.** This is so that we may discuss the assignment soon after the due date.

I understand that occasionally circumstances beyond your control (work, family emergencies, illness, etc.) may prevent you from completing an assignment on time. If that is the case, please e-mail me before the assignment is due and I will certainly consider your case.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please contact or see me as soon as possible. Often an email explanation or a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (<a href="mailto:Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu">Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu</a>), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office (ST 110C). My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page (<a href="http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/" target="_blank">http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/</a>) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include "[CS-140]" in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.**

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University's Student Code of Conduct (<a href="http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/</a>).

## Student Responsibilities 
* Contribute to a class atmosphere that is conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don't just lurk!
* Seek help when necessary.
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted. Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments.
* Make use of the academic success center (see below).
* Expect to spend at least 22 hours of work per week on class work.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Americans with Disabilities Act/Student Accessibility Services
Worcester State University and this instructor are committed to the full participation of all students, and will provide accommodations for any student with documented disabilities who are registered with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://www.worcester.edu/Student-Accessibility-Services/). The SAS is located in the Administration Building, Room 131 and can be reached by phone (508-929-8733) or email (<a href="mailto:sas@worcester.edu">sas@worcester.edu</a>).  

Please contact the instructor as early as possible to discuss necessary accommodations. All information regarding disabilities will be treated with confidentiality. 

##Math Center
If you are looking for tutoring for a math course or a course with math components, the [Math Center](http://www.worcester.edu/SP-Math-Center/) is here to help. Housed in the Mathematics Department (Sullivan Academic Center, Room 143), the center is staffed with a supervisor and peer tutors who can provide you with a conceptual mathematical understanding that will enable you to succeed in your courses and complete your assignments independently. 

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the [Academic Success Center (ASC)](http://www.worcester.edu/SP-Academic-Success-Center/).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible.

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.  To schedule an appointment, please call 508-929-8112 or email the Center at writingcenter@worcester.edu.  To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center's hours and the Center's Online Writing Lab, visit their website at <a href="http://www.worcester.edu/SP-Writing-Center/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/SP-Writing-Center/</a>.

## Worcester State Library
[Worcester State Library](http://www.worcester.edu/Library/) has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees---please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. All work must be done independently unless assigned as a group project. You may discuss assignments and materials with other students, but you should never share answers or files. ***Everything that you turn in must be your own original work, unless specified otherwise in the assignment.***

Students may help each other understand the programming language and the development environment but students may not discuss actual solutions, design or implementation, to their programming assignments before they are submitted or share code or help each other debug their programming assignments. The assignments are the primary means used to teach the techniques and principles of computer programming; only by completing the programs individually will students receive the full benefit of the assignments. If you are looking at each other’s code before you submit your own, you are in violation of this policy. 

I will be using software that compares submitted programs to identify cheating. This program is not fooled by changing variable names or rearranging code.

Students may not use solutions to assignments from any textbooks other than the text assigned for the course, or from any person other than the instructor, or from any internet site, or from any other source not specifically allowed by the instructor. If a student copies a solution from an unauthorized source and submits it as a solution to an assignment, the student will receive a 0 for that assignment.

**Any inappropriate sharing of work or use of another's work without attribution will result in a grade of zero on that assignment for all parties involved. If you do so a second time, you will receive an "E" for the course.**

Academic integrity is an essential component of a Worcester State education. Education is both the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills that lead to further intellectual development. Faculty are expected to follow strict principles of intellectual honesty in their own scholarship; students are held to the same standard. Only by doing their own work can students gain the knowledge, skills, confidence and self-worth that come from earned success; only by learning how to gather information, to integrate it and to communicate it effectively, to identify an idea and follow it to its logical conclusion can they develop the habits of mind characteristic of educated citizens. Taking shortcuts to higher or easier grades results in a Worcester State experience that is intellectually bankrupt.

Academic integrity is important to the integrity of the Worcester State community as a whole. If Worcester State awards degrees to students who have not truly earned them, a reputation for dishonesty and incompetence will follow all of our graduates. Violators cheat their classmates out of deserved rewards and recognition. Academic dishonesty debases the institution and demeans the degree from that institution.  

It is in the interest of students, faculty, and administrators to recognize the importance of academic integrity and to ensure that academic standards at Worcester State remain strong. Only by maintaining high standards of academic honesty can we protect the value of the educational process and the credibility of the institution and its graduates in the larger community.

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College's Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears in: <a href="http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/</a>**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**
